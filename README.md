# ZomatoReview_Alert
Zomato has become a popular restaurant catalog across India. Zomato also has a developer API. This can be found at https://developers.zomato.com/api . The objective of this problem, assuming that you are working for a restaurant, is to be able to get alerts(as fast as possible) when a user writes a negative review. Using the API endpoints available according to the documentation, i picked a particular popular restaurant and implemented a solution that will send email alerts on receipt of negative reviews. Negative reviews are not just classified on the basis of the rating but also the sentiment of the review text is taken into consideration.
